DATA COMPRESSION PROJECT

ALGORITHM 1: HUFFMAN COMPRESSION TECHNIQUE

IT IS TO BE RUN THROUGH COMMAND LINE ITSELF

USAGE IS : <output command> <INPUT FILE NAME> <DESTINATION FILENAME> -C(-c)(for compression)|-DC(-dc)(for decompression)

the file is compressed in destination file using frequency count and by huffman tree using encoded strings(bits).

decompression work is in progress.

sample input & output files are included in repository to show how both files will look like.

NOTE: WORKS ONLY FOR ASCII FILES.


ALGORITHM 2: RUN LENGTH ENCODING

usage is same as huffman that is : <a.out> <source> <destination>

it counts repitative characters in an ascii string and just writes the character and its count in the encoded string.
